# Architecture Decision Records

Each ADR captures one significant decision: its context, the choice made, and the
consequences. ADRs are immutable once **Accepted** — to change a decision, add a new ADR
that supersedes the old one (note it in both).

Format: [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)-lite — Status · Context · Decision · Consequences.

| ADR                                     | Title                                   | Status   |

| [0005](0005-audit-log.md)               | Audit log: append-only + hash chain     | Accepted |

| [0007](0007-security-standards.md)      | Security-standard mapping               | Accepted |

> Decisions deferred to later phases (verification aggregator, ERP target, spend-band
> ladder, break-glass policy) are tracked as assumptions in the relevant ADR and in
> `CLAUDE.md`, and will each get their own ADR when resolved.
